Parsing a command-line during run-time is supposed to be as simple as forwarding elements from ```argv``` to a dictionary-like structure.

With *lutline* you achieve that by generating a look-up table and the robotic code to read it while looping through `argv`.

The pattern customization available in *lutline* provides great versatility without compromising the efficiency of the generated parser code.
